# 30 Days of Solidity

Welcome to my "30 Days of Solidity" challenge repository! This project documents my journey of learning and implementing a variety of smart contracts, one per day, to explore different concepts and use cases within the Ethereum and blockchain ecosystem.

Each contract aims to tackle a specific problem or demonstrate a particular feature of Solidity and smart contract development, ranging from simple utility contracts to more complex DeFi and NFT interactions.

## üöÄ Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

- **Deepen understanding:** To solidify my knowledge of Solidity, its syntax, patterns, and best practices.
- **Explore diverse use cases:** To build mini contracts covering various domains like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, oracles, security patterns, and more.
- **Practical application:** To move beyond theory and gain hands-on experience in writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

## ‚ú® Key Concepts Explored

Throughout this challenge, I work with various important concepts in smart contract development, including:

- **Core Solidity:** State variables, functions, modifiers, events, error handling (`require`, `revert`, `assert`).
- **Data Structures:** Mappings, structs, arrays.
- **ERC Standards:** ERC20 (fungible tokens), ERC721 (non-fungible tokens)
- **DeFi Primitives:** Automated Market Makers (AMMs), lending/borrowing, yield farming, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), stablecoins (conceptual).
- **Governance:** Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), token-based voting, timelocks.
- **Security:** Reentrancy attacks and prevention, access control (Ownable, role-based), signature verification.
- **Oracles:** Interaction with external data sources (Chainlink VRF, conceptual weather oracle).
- **Gas Optimization:** Techniques for writing more efficient smart contracts.
- **Upgradability:** Basic proxy patterns.
- **Oracles:** Interaction with external data sources (Chainlink VRF, conceptual weather oracle).
- **Development Tools & Libraries:** Use of tools like Remix, and libraries like OpenZeppelin, Chainlink contracts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Solidity:** The primary language for smart contract development.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts:** Utilized for standard implementations like ERC20, ERC721, Ownable, etc., promoting security and best practices.
- **Chainlink VRF:** For provably random number generation in the Decentralized Lottery.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArunRawat404/30-Days-Solidity.git
    cd 30-Days-Solidity
    ```
2.  **Explore the contracts:** Each contract is typically a `.sol` file. You can review the code and the commit history for more context on its development.
3.  **Compile & Deploy:** Use your preferred Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix, Hardhat, Foundry) to compile, deploy, and interact with these contracts on a local blockchain or testnet.
